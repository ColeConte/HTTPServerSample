# chrome-extension-remote-filesystem
Google Chrome extension to allow for quick saving of web content to a remote filesystem.

This design project taught me and my partners Maria and Andrew how to create and communicate with an HTTP server, and how to build a Google Chrome extension (and the web development tools associated with that).
